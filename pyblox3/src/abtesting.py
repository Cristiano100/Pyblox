# Info for sanjay, v1/enrollments is v1/get-enrollments, but the only difference is, is that SubjectType is a string
# not an integer, but v1/enrollments can take an integer for SubjectType, as you can tell, this has enforced suffering
# upon me. Also v1/get-enrollments can take strings for SubjectType, I believe 2 different engineers worked on these
# endpoints, therefore they do the exact same thing, ABTestService didn't exist until 2018, so I can't see internal
# code for it, my head hurts.

# TODO Consider removing my existence
# FIXME The awful code below.
